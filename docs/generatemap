Creating a map:

North: n
East: e
South: s
West: w

Waypoint Syntax: w:dir
Example:  w:s - Creates a waypoint that directs the unit south from there to the next waypoint

Start Point Syntax: s:id
Example: s:00 - Identifies a starting point with an arbitrary id number. Connects to it's associated end point

End Point Syntax: e:id
Example: e:00 - Identifies an end point with an arbitrary id number. Connects to it's associated start point

Doodad Sytax: d:id
Example: d:05 - Creates doodad number 5 at that location. Doodads can be places anywhere except waypoints, start points, end points


Based on start, end, and waypoints the game will automatically generate the level
